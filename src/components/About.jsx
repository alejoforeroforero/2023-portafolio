                My core expertise lies in JavaScript, and I've been proactively expanding my skill set into crafting RESTful web applications using the MERN stack. I'm highly motivated to collaborate with fellow developers on the creation and implementation of robust web APIs, or to contribute my skills to web projects that are music-related or centered around digital narratives.

                My programming journey began in 2008 at the American company Eximo, where I gained strong JavaScript knowledge over three years. For nearly a decade afterward, I served as a professor at renowned universities in Bogot√° (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Universidad de los Andes, Universidad Nacional de Colombia), instructing interdisciplinary courses that combined art and technology. These courses spanned a range of programming languages, with a particular emphasis on projects involving Arduino, as well as the creation of digital images and narratives using tools like Processing, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and P5.js.

                During the pandemic (2020-2022), I focused on web-based educational projects in collaboration with my university students and worked as an independent front-end developer. This period rekindled my passion for programming and motivated me to fully commit to this field.

                In the past year, I have focused on refining my coding skills and gained experience in using libraries like GSAP and React. At this point in my career, I would like to take a step forward and join a development team while also seeking to gain experience in React, as it is the JavaScript library I wish to make my primary focus.

                Currently, my primary source of income comes from my work as a programmer, which allows me to allocate time to pursue my personal projects as a musician, where I'm actively collaborating with the world-renowned band, the Meridian Brothers.
